Try running the VSCODE Terminal as Administrator first.
> Right Click on VSCODE app/.exe > Compatibility > Check "Run As Administrator" > Save
> install Netlify CLI > npm install netlify-cli --save-dev
> Create script on package.json
    "netlify" : "netlify dev"

> When you initialize "netlify dev" script, you will run netlify cli locally.
> Your server will now be http://localhost:8888 (localhost:5173 on VITE)

If you're using Auth0, you need to add the new localhost server address which is
http://localhost:8888 on your Auth0 Application URIs.

Don't forget to remove/not include the new url's forward slash at the end as always or else Auth0 won't work.

You need to (somehow) logged-in on the netlify website in order for the script to run.
